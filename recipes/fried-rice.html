<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fried rice has long been a staple of Aussie takeaway dinners.  And, while we might all have our 
    favourite restaurant that makes Chinese fried rice just the way 
    we like it, satisfying fried rice is a dish that's surprisingly easy 
    to replicate at home. It's also a great way to use up any freshly cooked 
    rice that's been leftover from the night before.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup Coles Long Grain White Rice</li>
    <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
    <li>2 bacon rashers, chopped</li>
    <li>1 carrot, peeled and grated</li>
    <li>2 shallots, trimmed, finely sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
    <li>Sesame seeds, to serve</li>
    <li>Shallots, sliced, extra, to serve</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cook the 1 cup Coles Long Grain White Rice in a large saucepan of boiling water for 
    12 minutes or until tender. Drain and leave to cool. </li>

    <li> Heat 2 tsp vegetable oil in non-stick wok or large frying pan over medium heat. 
        Add 2 eggs, lightly whisked. Swirl over base to form an omelette.

        Set aside to cool slightly. Roll up and thickly slice. </li>

    <li> Add 2 bacon rashers, chopped to wok. Cook 4 minutes until light golden. 
        Add 1 carrot, peeled and grated. 
        Stir fry 1 minute. Add 2 shallots, trimmed, finely sliced, 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed  and rice. 
        Cook, stirring, 3-4 minutes. Add egg and 1 tbsp soy sauce. Stir until heated through.
